# Chinook-Database-Analysis
In this SQL project for the Chinook database, I identified managers with at least 2 direct reports, calculated revenue from MPEG-4 video purchases in 2024, counted distinct playlists for classical composers, and found customers with strictly increasing yearly spending. These analyses aim to enhance management, revenue tracking, &amp; customer insights.
